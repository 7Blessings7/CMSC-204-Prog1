        "In all honesty, this data structure is quite common at work and I have been using/dealing with arrays for over 6 years already. So, frankly speaking I could say that it was my experience that helped implement this data structure coupled with my previous training on python.\n",

        "2. What made this implementation challenging?\n",
        "\n",
        "Primarily this was challenging because I limited myself to use basic functions rather than using pre-defined functions on python. For example, the use of dataframes, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "It was also challenging because it was quite basic and I had to re-read basic documentation to implement the tasks at hand. I was also confused with the remove() and pop() function at first because of the documentation. I also was challenge by the fact that this is quite different to my usual programming style.\n",

        "I overcame the above challenges by re-reading documentations and doing trial and error. It also helped that I went over some of my classmates' work since I couldn't actualize yet how a programming log should be created."
